The `app.json` file in an Expo project contains the configuration settings for the application. Some of the key properties defined in this file include the application name, slug, version, orientation, icons, splash screen details, and platform-specific settings for iOS and Android.

This configuration file is important for setting up the basic properties of the Expo application, ensuring that the application is properly identified and displayed across different platforms and devices.
